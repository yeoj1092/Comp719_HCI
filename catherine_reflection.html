              Our team conducted a report which includes usability study and research. The primary goal of this assignment was to demonstrate our understanding of conducting a research method and usability study on a website of our choosing which was Oodle.com. We have gathered data collection by our participant’s cooperation and interaction with the website. Hence, along our analysis and findings in this research we have written a report that helps develop the possible improvements of the chosen website based on the fundamentals of HCI.
              <br><br>
              As our team decided to conduct a usability test, we needed to find a computerised artefact or software that had problems. According to Robert, our lecturer, we should avoid using polished artefacts or software, as well as a well-developed website, because we will most likely not have a lot of data to work with. As a result, we considered using Oodle because we were confident that we would get a lot more data to work with.
              <br><br>
              My primary role throughout the study was to collect real-time participant interaction with the website. We gave them 5 minutes to explore the website without assigning any tasks to avoid restricting the user to specific functions. As half of usability is determined by what the user perceives when attempting to use the website, such as their first impressions of it. As a result, we did not lose the ability to determine what they see when attempting to use the website.
              <br><br>
              In this research I have learnt that there were forms of analysis within qualitative research in which Thematic Analysis is one of the most common forms of it, which is being utilised in our team’s research. This study has shown me that qualitative research is most preferred method than quantitative research because qualitative research is used when the researcher has no specific objective or expected outcome in which what we have done in this research. While quantitative research it is more objective, fast and focused.
              <br><br>
              In conclusion, our team's usability study and research segment were overall interesting and engaging, especially since we worked with the participants.
