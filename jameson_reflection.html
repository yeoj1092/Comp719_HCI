                  Our team, Beige, was given the assignment to create a report that included research and usability studies. The assignment's objective was to demonstrate our capacity for research and to carry out a structured usability study that enables the team to assess a website's usability based on watching how users interact with it in real-time. A report that analyses these results and offers advice based on these observations in relation to HCI principles should also be produced.
                  <br><br>
                  In this self-reflection, I'll look at what I've learned from the experience. My main focus had been on creating the study's research methods, including the thematic analysis (literature review), analysis techniques, and the study itself. I also contributed in creating the participation sheet and the consent forms.
                  <br><br>
                  In the documentation for the consent form and information sheet. This procedure wasn't challenging. however, it had shown me how to write the documentation for a usability study. This will be added to any future studies in which participants are required.
                  <br><br>
                  Starting out with thematic analysis. I discovered it to be a technique for data analysis that involves researching a dataset to spot recurring patterns, then followed by examining and documenting them. During the research, there were different approaches which were inductive, deductive, semantic, and latent approach. 
                  <br><br>
                  In our team, we ended up using thematic analysis to conduct our useability study with the inductive approach. The inductive approach involves deriving meanings and creating themes from the data collected (eg. getting data without any prior themes). With the information gathered, we grouped the datasets into themes in our findings, which would be the results of our issue presented in the report.
                  <br><br>
                  When conducting the actual usability study, it was helpful to watch the participants during their process, occasionally, they would speak and record without saying a word, but the team could see what they were doing visually. This demonstrated how the findings and discussions differed greatly from those that would have resulted from simply watching the recording and going over the study's results. 
                  <br><br>
                  In general, I felt that the team report helped to clarify the usability study procedure for me. My understanding of exploratory analysis, the importance of thematic analysis, and further making recommendations, which I believed to be the foundation of effective usability results, was briefly expanded. As a result, I think I have a solid understanding of what a usability study is and that, if required, I will be able to conduct one.
