               Team Beige produced a report encompassing a usability study and research segment. The main objective of this assignment was to showcase our understanding of applying a research method and usability study on a website of our choice. In this case, we observed the participant's way of interacting with the site in real time. A report was developed with our analysis and findings, which expanded on potential improvements based on observations relating to the Human-Computer Interaction principles.
              <br><br>
              The team decided the best way to undertake this report was to firstly research methods we could use for a usability test. We read up on thematic analysis and decided that could be the best option as it was interesting for all of us. Thematic analysis was rated strongly for qualitative research. Following on, we needed to find a website that was ideally not as easily identifiable and came across Oodle. 
              <br><br>
              I collaborated with others on the first draft of the following sections: Introduction, Usability test, some of the findings and discussion and analysed the participants giving out code names and creating themes. Other team members helped improve the draft versions that I worked on.
              <br><br>
              I was present for three of the participants when they interacted with the website. I noticed different body actions whilst using the site, which helped me identify potential code words. Through these code words, I developed them in themes by finding the most common issues. The team applied thematic analysis and made reasonable recommendations on them.
              <br><br>
              I learned that conducting a qualitative research is more differcult than quantitative. Researchers need to decide on how they interpret the data as there is no general guideline. I found it interesting that it only takes four to five participants to understand roughly 80% of the main usability problems.
              <br><br>
              Overall the report was intriguing. This is the first time I have done a proper qualitative analysis.
