              Team Beige was tasked with creating a report that included quantitative research and a usability study. The goal of this project was to demonstrate our ability to conduct a formalized usability study that allows the group to evaluate the usability of a website based on actual observational data collected from participants interacting with the site. Write a report analyzing your findings and making recommendations based on your observations in relation to HCI principles.
              <br><br>
              Our team took a long time to decide on an object topic to research because none of us had any prior experience with quantitative research. Finally, we decided to use Oodle as our usability study object and to draw on some incredible resources on Thematic Analysis and Usability studies, namely those by Braun and Hornbaek. We assigned each group member a section of the report to write. In my observation, this is the most straightforward way to write a report in a group setting. I was in charge of writing the conclusion section of the report. and contributed to the findings as well as the creation of the participation sheet and consent forms I was not present to observe the subjects in action, so I cannot comment directly on the implementation of the usability study. However, we were capable of successfully identifying issues, applying thematic analysis, and making recommendations based on our notes and discussions.
              <br><br>
              Thematic analysis is a good way to start qualitative analysis, according to the research. Our lecturer Robert recommended thematic analysis as a method for conducting qualitative research based on the findings of this usability study. Because there is no clear way for the researchers to interpret the data, it is up to them to establish the rules and the foundation that will serve as points of reference.
              <br><br>
              We were aware of the report's outcome during our usability studies. We went into this study with the intent of actively seeking and pinpointing flaws. In a particular circumstance that wasn't completely obvious by now, we ended up choosing Oodle because it matched the desired outcome. A quick glance revealed easily identifiable design flaws, which would be ideal for generating discussion points for the report. Overall, I found this usability study to be enjoyable and interesting. It differs from what I previously studied and produced as part of my major. It has taught me how to conduct qualitative analysis as well as the significance of usability testing.
